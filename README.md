# Project Euler 050 - Consecutive Prime Sum

The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

    2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?
